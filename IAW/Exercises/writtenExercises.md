## 1. Find more server-side languages, and look for advantages and disadvantages in front of php.

There are a lot of php alternatives as server-side language.
We can have huge companies' solutions as Microsoft's ASP.NET or Oracle's
Java, or we can stand to more open solutions like Ruby on Rails, Perl or Python.
Also we can find client-side programming languages as Javascript used in servers,
with runtimes like node.js.
Actually, even C could be (with a little bit of work) a server-side programming
language.

The reason that we choose php in front of the others (even when is not the best) is because (according to W3Techs.com) is the most widely used. The 81.4% of the servers are using it, way more than the 16,4% of the second (ASP.NET).
